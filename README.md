This is a Watch Time Calculator that uses iterative algorithms for gathering video data and calculating total watch time. The first part of the program uses a while loop to continuously prompt the user for video titles, storing each title in a list until the user inputs 'exit'. In the second part, a for loop is used to iterate over the list of video titles, prompting the user to input the length of each video and storing these lengths in a dictionary where the keys are the video titles and the values are their corresponding lengths in minutes. The final part of the program calculates the total watch time using a combination of random selection and a for loop. It randomly selects two videos for each subscriber using the random.choice() function, and the total watch time is computed by summing the lengths of these two videos and multiplying by the number of subscribers. The result is then printed as the total watch time across all subscribers.
